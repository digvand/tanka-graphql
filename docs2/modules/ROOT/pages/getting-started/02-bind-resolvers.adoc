Tanka GraphQL provides few ways of binding resolvers to your schema.

* Bind manually using `SchemaBuilder`
* Bind using resolver maps by using `SchemaBuilder` or `SchemaTools`

=== Bind manually using `SchemaBuilder`

=== Bind using `SchemaTools` or `SchemaBuilder`

This approach uses a map of the types and fields to bind resolvers to fields.

NOTE: Binding is done when the method is called.

This is what you would usually do to bind the resolvers and create schema.
