# GraphQL library for Dotnet

I've been making contributions to [GraphQL.NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/) for some time but started feeling that I don't know enough how GraphQL should be executed. So I started writing my own executor strictly following the spec. This is the result of about 50 hours 
of experimentation and looking at various other implementation for other programming languages.

It's not meant as a competition for GraphQL.NET but as an alternative. Main different is that the type system of Fugu GraphQL is not bound to C# classes and interfaces.
